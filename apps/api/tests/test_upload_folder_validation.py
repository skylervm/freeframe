"""Tests for folder validation on POST /upload/initiate (#65).

Without this validation, a live asset could be created under a soft-deleted
(trashed) or foreign-project folder. The retention GC's `_purge_folder` deletes
assets by `folder_id` with no `deleted_at` filter (it must, to avoid FK
violations when the folder itself is hard-deleted), so an unvalidated
`folder_id` on initiate becomes a data-loss vector: a live asset silently
gets swept up and hard-deleted (S3 objects included) the next time its
trashed folder is purged.
