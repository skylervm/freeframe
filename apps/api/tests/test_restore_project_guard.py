"""Tests for restore-into-deleted-project guard (#65 adversarial-review fix A1).

There is no project-restore endpoint (only /assets/{id}/restore and /folders/{id}/restore) — a
soft-deleted project is permanent/purge-only. Without this guard, restoring an asset or folder whose
project is soft-deleted would report success while leaving the item parented under a project the
retention GC's `_purge_project` cascade will hard-delete on its next pass (with no re-check of
children's own deleted_at) — a silent, unrecoverable data-loss trap.
